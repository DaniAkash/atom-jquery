# jQuery

This is a collection of snippets for Atom, covering nearly all of the jQuery API. It was initially ported from my [TextMate bundle](https://github.com/kswedberg/jquery-tmbundle) and then refactored to work better in the Atom environment.

Contributions are always appreciated. Please fork this repo, make changes or additions, and send a pull request.

Thanks!
